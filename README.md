# ðŸŽ® Wordle Game

This is a simple Wordle-like game built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The main goal of this project was to practice DOM manipulation, working with APIs, and handling JSON data.

## What I Did

- Fetched daily words from an API.
- Built the game logic using JavaScript.
- Implemented dynamic feedback for guesses:
  - ðŸŸ© Correct letter in the correct position.
  - ðŸŸ¨ Correct letter in the wrong position.
  - â¬œ Wrong letter.
- Added simple animations and styling using CSS.
- Designed a clean and user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS.

## How It Works

- Users type in their guesses, and the game checks the letters against the daily word.
- The game provides visual feedback for each guess.
- After six attempts, the game reveals the correct word if not guessed.
